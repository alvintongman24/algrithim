Implementation of Insertion Sort using JavaScript:

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands. Each time we take a new card we put it in the right place in our hand.


Instructions

Each time work only with the first i-1 element from of the array
Pick element arr[i] and insert it into sorted sequence in the array from 0 to i-1.



function insertionSort(arr) {
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    let key = arr[i];
    let j = i - 1;
    
    // Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are greater than key, to one position ahead of their current position
    while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
      arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
      j = j - 1;
    }
    arr[j + 1] = key;
  }
  return arr;
}

// Example usage:
let arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6];
console.log("Sorted array: ", insertionSort(arr));
